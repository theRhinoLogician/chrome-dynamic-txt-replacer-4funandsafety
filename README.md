Chrome Dynamic Text Replacer (for lulz and browsing-trigger-free)
=============

Functionality
------------
Replaces any given word or phrase with a different one throughout your browsing experience.

Extension must have permission to view and edit all the pages you visit, which is why its so important that it be open source and publicly hosted on GitHub.  

Current Functionality (Alpha 0.1)
------------
Replaces a name I dislike with a different name, including variations for capitalization and the 'nick-name' version.

Until I add the Beta functionality, this extension is absolutely the same as 'Cloud to Butt' just with arbitrary word changes that are neither funny nor useful to anyone but the author.


Future-Functionality (Beta 0.9)
------------
Simple user GUI to choose which word / phrase is replaced, and how.
With this GUI, ordinary users can replace any words they want, easily, with no need to edit the Github source & rebuild the extension.


Future-Functionality (Release 1.0)
------------
Include a collection of preset suggestions in something like csv format, where the csv files can be shared.
Funny ones like millenials->snake people & cloud->butt.  
Political ones like DonaldTrump->Ahole.
Trigger-phrase ones too.  


Future-Functionality (Release 2.0)
------------
White-listing sites to turn off the javascript replacement.  
This will require a button / right-click menu
This will require a database, probably sqlite, to write the whitelisted sites into.


About
------------

Forked from 'Cloud to Butt', an extension that replaces occurrences of the phrase "the cloud" with "my butt"

http://www.flickr.com/groups/cloud-to-butt/

It was a funny extension. But I needed a more serious one that would allow me to trade out some names and phrases that were triggering bad reactions.  I realized I probably wasn't the only one who would like this functionality in Chrome.  


Installation
